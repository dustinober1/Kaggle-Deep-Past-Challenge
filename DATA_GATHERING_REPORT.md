# Data Gathering Report - Deep Past Challenge

## Summary

We successfully expanded the training data from **1,561 to 2,595 examples** - a **66% increase** in available training data.

## Data Sources Gathered

### 1. Original Training Data
- **1,556 document-level** translation pairs
- Source: `train.csv`
- Quality: High (human translations)

### 2. Sentence-Level Alignments  
- **1,032 sentence-level** translation pairs
- Source: `Sentences_Oare_FirstWord_LinNum.csv` aligned with `train.csv`
- Quality: High (extracted from training documents)
- Method: Matched sentence translations with corresponding transliteration segments using first-word markers

### 3. Publication Extractions
- **7 pairs** extracted from OCR'd publications
- Source: `publications.csv`
- Quality: Mixed (limited due to OCR noise)
- Note: 59,538 potential translations identified but most are scholarly commentary, not aligned pairs

### 4. Additional Resources Catalogued

| Resource | Count | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| AICC Translation URLs | 7,702 | Machine translations (poor quality but available) |
| Sentence Translations | 9,771 | English translations with first-word markers |
| Lexicon Entries | 39,332 | Word forms → dictionary lemmas |
| Dictionary Entries | 19,215 | Akkadian word definitions |
| Published Texts | 7,953 | Additional unlabeled transliterations |

## Final Training Set Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Examples** | **2,595** |
| Document Level | 1,556 (60%) |
| Sentence Level | 1,032 (40%) |
| Publication | 7 (<1%) |

### Text Length Statistics
| Field | Mean (chars) | Median (chars) |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Transliteration | 324 | 241 |
| Translation | 337 | 171 |

## Key Improvements

1. **66% more training data** compared to original train.csv
2. **Sentence-level pairs** that better match the test format
3. **Mixed document/sentence training** for better generalization
4. **Catalogued additional resources** for future use

## Recommendations for Model Training

1. **Use `final_training_data.csv`** as primary training data
2. **Consider curriculum learning**: Start with document-level, then sentence-level
3. **Data augmentation**: Use lexicon for vocabulary expansion
4. **Multi-task learning**: Train on both document and sentence translation
5. **Future work**: Better extraction from publications with improved OCR parsing

## Scripts Created

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/data_gathering.py` | Main data gathering pipeline |
| `scripts/aicc_scraper.py` | AICC URL scraping (URLs catalogued) |
| `scripts/translation_extractor.py` | Publication translation extraction |
